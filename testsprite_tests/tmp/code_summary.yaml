known_limitations:
  - issue: CORS proxy fallback chain may fail for some URLs
    location: supabase/functions/analyze-response-sheet/index.ts
    impact: URL fetching may fail if all proxies are unavailable
  - issue: Exam config must be manually selected, not auto-detected from URL
    location: src/components/HeroInput.tsx
    impact: Users must know their exam type to select correctly
  - issue: Text extraction with line breaks is newly implemented and may need testing
    location: src/lib/parseSSCHtml.ts
    impact: Option text formatting may not be perfect for all HTML structures
